# CodingCamp_hw1- Code-Refactor
This is my first homework project in my codingcamp class.
The objective of this project is to refactor an existing webpage codebase for a marketing agency to make it more accessible.
In other words, people with disabilities should be able to navigate the site without any limitations.
This will ensure that the codebase follows the accessibility standards and avoid any litigations that might arise in the future.
That being said, the most important part of this project is to keep it clean as much as possible. This will ensure easy maintenance and review by other developers.
Besides what was mentioned above, the project has another objective which is to replace any non-semantic elements with semantic ones.
In order to fulfil these objectives, I followed the steps bellow:
- I saved the codebase and itâ€™s content files to my local machine
- I opened the code thru VScode. 
- I reviewed the code
- I opened the code thru a browser to review how it looks currently 
- As I have the code open in a browser, I started making changes in the codebase as follows:
   * I  updated the title of the page.
   * I added an anchor element to the logo of the page to point to the main page once clicked.
   * I added an anchor element to the list items in the header to point to their correspondent sections within the webpage. 
   * I replaced the div non-semantic elements with nav semantic elements in the index.html file.
   * I added alt attributes to each image.
   * I added a description title to each image. 
   * I added comments to each CSS style/element in the CSS file. 
   * I added spacing between each class section in the CSS file for better visibility.
   * I made sure that every element follows a logical structure as per the html file.
   * I saved all my changes. 
   * I reviewed the changes in a browser as I made them. 
   * I created a repository for the project/homework called Codingcamp_hw1.
   * I created a clone locally on my machine.
   * I moved/copied the homework/project files to the cloned folder.
   * I pushed the new copied files to github.
   * I reviewed the files in github. 
   * I created the project link/URL thru github pages and made sure it is working and public.
